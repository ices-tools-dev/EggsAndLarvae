### Unified portal to access data from ichthyoplankton surveys carried out in ICES areas

Fish egg and fish larvae data have been collected in the ICES area for a long time for use in stock assessments and fisheries management. The collection of the data is usually organized by international survey expert groups. The Eggs and Larvae database aims to store, and make available, data collected by ichthyoplankton surveys for use by ICES and the wider marine community. It provides an overview of available fish egg and larvae survey data, and a unified portal for access to the ichthyoplankton survey data.
